# Fountain Scene Numbers
A tool for automatically setting scene numbers in Fountain files

Live version: http://kapitan.fi/fountain

I love the plain-text Fountain screenplay format, but the biggest of its downsides is the lack of continuous and automatical scene numbering. None of the apps using Fountain as their internal format still don't provide this feature, so if you use Slugline, Logline or Writer (or just a plain text editor) to write your script, this tool might come in handy when sending your script for review or production.

Just drag your script on the textarea and download the file. I've tested this on some scripts, including the sample Fountain stuff, and so far it seems to have worked with no problems.
